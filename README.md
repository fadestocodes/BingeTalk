I'm an indie full-stack developer and content creator building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All video content is built the same way, from ideation and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. I publish that content on my YouTube channel  to more than 600k subscribers.

 <summary><h3>üìñ  A little backstory</h3></summary>
Prior to jumping into the world of software development, I was pursuing a career in the film industry as a cinematographer. I loved the medium of visual storytelling, the beautiful imagery, and the magic of filmmaking. Around this time there was an app gaining popularity, it was a place to track your watches and rate films. It was just what I was looking for, a community of other film lovers. Except, over time I kept saying to myself, "I wish I could do this or that on the app". 

Fast forward a few years, after some tough times I made the decision to go all in on software development as a career path. I took some online courses, learned any and everything I possibly could, and once I completed my courses I knew I needed to build a portfolio to land a job. What could I possibly build that'll be impressive enough to help me start my new career...

The seed had been planted and I've had months to brainstorm ideas for this. By this point I had everything I needed to build that app with all the features I wanted a few years ago. That app doesn't have all the features I thought would make it even better? Well then I guess I'll make my own. It took 4 months of programming, testing, and solving countless problems, but on April 23, 2025 Bingeable had been launched on the iOS App Store. 

I've got a lot of plans for the app, a lot more features to make it the best app for anyone that loves films and TV shows. So stay tuned, and follow me on Bingeable!
