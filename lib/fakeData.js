        dialogue : "Having Paul Mescal essentially be Maximus 2.0 sounds like a cool idea, but it‚Äôs ultimately a reminder that very few actors had the level of magnetism Crowe had in 2000. Wouldn‚Äôt say he is sauceless and the script rehashing the first movie isn‚Äôt doing his characters any favors, but there is an element that is missing. \n\nFortunately, Denzel is one of the greatest actors to walk this earth, so even when the movie crumbles under its own grandiosity towards the end, serving up a lukewarm climax, he is always there reminding us that he is the reason we are so entertained. Him and any scene that involves a battle in the colosseum."

        parentComment : "We're just here to be memories for our kids. Still just a miracle of a movie in which Nolan found a way to merge his blockbuster scaled science-fiction imagery with personal ideas about being a father on a dying planet and how his professional/technical passions are directly connected to losing to time with his children, finding a way to package them both as something that contains a bit of The Right Stuff, Solaris, Close Encounters (if we stuck with the wonder-obsessed dad after he left his kids behind), and 2001 obviously.All crashing into each other via Nolan's often cold, literal-minded precision and momentum-driven construction that attempts to turn scientific theory about time and space and very basic existential and emotional ideas of generational mortality and hope into something not just physically tangible but physically achievable. The inherent thrill of innovation and exploration reflected in space travel sequences (a blend of his usual tactile craftsmanship and attempt at black hole photography so 'accurate' it achieves an even more abstract beauty than it would otherwise) and Zimmer's astonishingly bombastic and melancholy electronic organ score never too far removed from the desolate, unforgiving reality of ecological deterioration and the grim, cynical side of our individual survival instincts.",

        dialogue : "Going to a film in a theater is an experience. Regardless if the film is good or bad, a masterpiece or a failure; when the house lights go down, something magical occurs. The audience is taken to new places, they discover new ideas or feelings, and every few decades or so, a film can shake your inner-being to your core. Interstellar shook my inner-being to my core. I'm not kidding, exaggerating, or being hyperbolic; this film put me in a state that can only be described as transcendent, religious even. Seeing this in 70mm IMAX only magnified that transcendent experience, and I wish I could describe my joy, love, adoration, delight, jubilation, and utter bliss that Interstellar brought to me."

Any bit with Shia had me dying laughing in the theater. It‚Äôs like watching an alien pretend to be a human. Every weird little movement or rhyme he did made it feel like I was watching some strange ET like creature trying to become a person. So many memorable lines from him, 'revenge tastes best while wearing a dress' and 'can I not get rid of this fucking cousin?'",
